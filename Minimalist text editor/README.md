# 🌙 Minimalist Text Editor

Welcome to the **Minimalist Text Editor** – the easiest way to type, write, or even daydream about writing without distractions. Whether you're jotting down notes, writing a novel, or composing the next big tech startup pitch, this editor’s got your back (and your keyboard). 

## Features 🚀

- **Dark Mode & Light Mode**: The power of choice! Switch between Dark Mode for those late-night coding sessions and Light Mode for the bright sunny mornings when your mind is fresh (or at least pretending to be).
- **Character Counter**: Keep track of your words, whether you’re composing a poem or just writing your grocery list. It's all about the numbers, baby.
- **Auto-Save**: Never fear losing your precious thoughts again! This editor saves everything as you go. Like a digital guardian angel, but cooler.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Forget about Ctrl + S! This editor already has you covered. Just type away, and we'll handle the saving.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on desktop, mobile, or whatever weird screen you decide to use.
