# 🌙 Minimalist Text Editor

Welcome to the **Minimalist Text Editor** – the easiest way to type, write, or even daydream about writing without distractions. Whether you're jotting down notes, writing a novel, or composing the next big tech startup pitch, this editor’s got your back (and your keyboard).

## Features 🚀

- **Dark Mode & Light Mode**: The power of choice! Switch between Dark Mode for those late-night coding sessions and Light Mode for the bright sunny mornings when your mind is fresh (or at least pretending to be).
- **Character Counter**: Keep track of your words, whether you’re composing a poem or just writing your grocery list. It's all about the numbers, baby.
- **Auto-Save**: Never fear losing your precious thoughts again! This editor saves everything as you go. Like a digital guardian angel, but cooler.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Forget about Ctrl + S! This editor already has you covered. Just type away, and we'll handle the saving.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on desktop, mobile, or whatever weird screen you decide to use.
- **Emoji IntelliSense**: Type `:` followed by an emoji name (e.g., `:smile` for 😄). A dropdown will appear with suggestions. Use arrow keys to navigate and press Enter to insert.

## Getting Started 🏁

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. Or don’t. It’s up to you.
2. Open the `index.html` in your browser (it’s a browser-based editor, after all).
3. Start typing your masterpiece, whether it’s a novel, to-do list, or secret evil plan.

## How to Use ✍️

1. **Write Stuff**: Seriously, that's the point. Write anything. Write everything.
2. **Switch Themes**: Tap the dark mode/light mode button and impress your friends with your preference for either late-night or early-morning vibes.
3. **Track Characters**: Whether you’re aiming for brevity or wordiness, we’ve got your character count covered.
4. **Auto-Save**: We save your work so you don't have to. It’s like magic, but with more coding.
5. **Manual Save**: If autosave wasn't good enough, you can use Ctrl + S to easily save without having any worries.
6. **Emoji IntelliSense**:
   - Type `:` followed by an emoji name (e.g., `:fire` for 🔥).
   - Use arrow keys to navigate the suggestions.
   - Press Enter or click to insert the emoji instantly.
