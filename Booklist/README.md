# Booklist App

A simple web-based booklist app that allows users to add books with a title, author, and year of publication. The app stores the data locally using `localStorage`, so your list persists even after you refresh the page.

## Features

- Data persists across page reloads using `localStorage`.
- Clear the list by pressing `Ctrl + B`.
- Input validation to ensure data is properly entered.

## How to Use

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Enter the title, author, and year of the book in the respective input fields.
3. Click the **Add Book** button to add the book to the list.
4. The book will appear in the table below the inputs.
5. Books are stored in `localStorage`, so they remain even after refreshing the page.
6. Press `Ctrl + B` to clear the list.

## Running Locally

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to start using the app.
