# JavaScript Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects I've completed as part of my JavaScript course, along with personal projects I've created to practice and showcase my skills.  
It serves as a playground for learning and experimenting with JavaScript concepts.  

⚠️ **Note**: This repo is used for learning purposes and is not intended for legitimate projects.  
    **Note**: The designs of the projects are not created by me, I am only responsible for the JavaScript functionality.
